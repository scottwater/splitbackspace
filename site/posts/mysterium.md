The [Mysterium](https://www.cftkb.com/shop/mysterium-tkl-diy-keyboard-kit) is a TKL through-hole produced by [CFTKB](https://www.cftkb.com). It is the much bigger sibling of the [Romeo](https://scottw.com/boards/romeo_spring/) (and slightly larger sibling of the Discipline).

The case was expertly designed and built by [Switch Couture](https://switchcouture.com). It consists of five layers of stacked acrylic. In addition, there is an included a 5mm acrylic plate that holds the switches nice a snug.

The Mysterium itself is a WK TKL, but the case was designed to be WKL because _this is the way_.

I was trying to decide between Tealios and the Tangerines for this build. I thought the aesthetic of the clear Tealios would be an excellent way to go with the bi-frost acrylic case, and I love the feel of them. However, the Tealios sound is not as good as the Tangerines in my testing, so I went good feel and great sound over great feel and dull sound.

There is no real reason to match your switches and stabilizers. However, if you can do so, then go for it. So once I decided on Tangerines, the using orange C3 stabs was a no brainer.

I lubed and filmed switches about a week before I started to do the final build. I noticed that many of the switch housing had started to become loose after sitting in the bucket they shipped in for a week. I am not sure if it was just my batch of switches, the films, or whatnot, but I was concerned that any switch that was not appropriately surrounded all sides by the 5mm acrylic plate would eventually push open. So, I pulled out the films for the stabilized keys (2x shift, enter, and backspace). The Thicc films might not have been an issue, but it was an easy pre-solder change to make.

After the switches had been soldered, I grabbed a pair of rubber gloves, a small vacuum, and tried to assemble with the least amount of dust and fingerprints as possible.

Some final thoughts:

- I was skeptical of an acrylic case. The sound is significantly better than I expected. Overall, the entire case exceeded my expectations. I have a Switch Couture Alice on the way, and I am very much looking forward to it.
- If you go the same route and need to flash the board, do so before you put the PCB in the case. The default keycode to put the PCB in boot loader mode is also the key that is inaccessible via the WKL blocker. The Mysterium has a hardware reset button, but that too is blocked via the case. :)
- Regardless of the case, flash VIA on this. It is great. This too _is the way_.
- I wish the PCB supported split backspace. 80+ keys are plenty, but I like the consistency of always doing split backspace (I would also like a right split shift :))
- This board is surprisingly hard to photograph. It changes quite a bit in the light, depending on how you look at it. Please do not let me crappy photography skills scare you away. It is amazing.
