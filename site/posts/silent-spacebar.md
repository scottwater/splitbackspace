On the [KBD67 MKII build post](https://splitbackspace.com/posts/kbd67-mkii/), I mentioned switching to a silent switch on the spacebar.

This is not something I expect to do all the time, but it was a big improvement with the Zykos on a brass plate. I felt it would be good to highlight the two sound profiles below if you wanted to do a quick side by side comparison.
