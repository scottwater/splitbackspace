The Key65 has been my most used board since the moment it hit my desk. It has been a joy to use.

I ended up with quite a few plates (Brass, FR4, PC, and  Carbon fiber) and a couple of solder and hot-swap PCBs. The hot-swap PCBs are not my preferred layout, but they have let me experiment quite a bit.

So far, my favorite combination has been the NK Dry Blacks + FR4.

## Quick Thoughts

* This is my first WKL 65%. The community as a whole is quite skeptical about this layout, but I prefer it. One Control, Command, and Alt key works perfectly fine for me.
* The Kanji blocker is so much better than the key logo. I do not understand why so many went with the key logo.
* All of my solder PCBs had issues using split backspace. The recommended fix is to fill it up with solder. Over soldering felt too messy, and I was concerned with long term issues. Instead, I used a mill max socket, and this has worked out quite nicely.
