The main reason I bought the [Rama M60-A](https://rama.works/m60-a) was the [Jony Ive](https://scottw.com/boards/jony) (all white) build. The initial build turned out great, but after a while, it was starting to feel a bit sterile, so I decided to mix things up a bit.

The keycap change was 100% aesthetics. It was just nice to switch things out. The Hagormo alphas are a much softer white than GMK Minimal, and I think it worked well. The Monochrome[^2] base set is great and will find it's way without the white alphas to a keyboard shortly.

For the deskmat, besides the design, the other benefit was the size. I had previously been using the Rama Canvas XL. The Canvas materials are top-notch, but despite the XL name, it is quite a bit smaller than your typical NovelKeys (and Dixie/etc.) deskmat. And of course, the design is great

Finally, the real star of this rebuild was the switches. I have enjoyed the Mauves. I started out using them unlubed, and they were pretty good right out of the bag and had a nice deep `thock`. Once lubed, they got considerably smoother, but at the cost of some of that before mentioned thock. I also took the opportunity to try out some Thick Thock 68g progressive springs. I am not if my touch is sensitive enough to feel the progression, but I liked them none the less. I am curious if there will be a more noticeable change with a heavier spring, so I ordered the 74g. I will report back in the future when they make it to the US.

This board is still an absolute joy to use, and I have my eye on the next build already. :)
