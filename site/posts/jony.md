Most of the keyboards I have built have been the result of finding different parts that were available at the time. This build was the first time I purposely set out to acquire a specific set of components.

The main components:

- [Rama M60-A SEQ2](https://rama.works/#/m60a-seq2/) in the Milk colorway
- GMK Minimal Keycaps
- Custom White SummitCable

The board and visible parts are white as snow, but this board is most definitely not a snowflake. :). It was milled from a single piece of aluminum and weights about 3lbs 10oz including keycaps/switches (but not including the internal weight/dampener).

For the last couple of months it has been my goto board and has been an absolute joy to use.

Everything else:

- Hotswap PCB
- Durock stabs from NovelKeys. This was the first time I did not adhere the band-aids to the PCB. This made the entire process far more enjoyable and as far as I can tell, they have not moved.
- Holy Pandas, lubed with Tribosys 3204. I initially started out with Mauves, but switched after a day or two (the Mauves are great, just wanted to roll with the HPs for a while).

The board (as with all Rama's) is [Via](https://scottw.com/blog/via/) compatible so setting it up and making some customizations was a snap.

My only minor gripe is the shiny back weight. It is stunning look at, but you do not get to see it since it faces your computer screen. In addition, it is impossible to not have it covered in finger prints. I tried my best to photograph it, but they all came out horrible. :)

This was my first Rama, but certainly not the last. I regret not getting in on the M65-B or U80-A. Hopefully I can fix that in the coming months.

I have a sound dampener and internal weight on order. Once I have them, I will grab some sound tests of the various states.
