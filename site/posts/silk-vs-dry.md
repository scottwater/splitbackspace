Some find lubing switches relaxing. I am not one of those people. For me, it is a necessary evil, so I was excited to try the new pre-lubed Novel Keys pre-lubed Silk series and compare them to the Dry[^jwk] series (not lubed switches).

I did two identical builds, except for the switches.

Each build:

1. Key65 FR4 Plates
2. Key65 Hot-swap PCB[^sbs]
3. Durock stabilizers

For the switches, I went with the black variant of both the Silk and Dry. For the Silks, they are 100% stock. For the Dry switches, I lubed the stems very lightly with 205g0 (springs with 105) and filmed them with TX switch films.

Overall, the Silks are much better than I expected. If you have never used lubed switches and switched to the silks, you would likely see a significant improvement in both feel and sound.

Of the two, I still favor the modified Dry switches, but this is expected since I modified them according to my personal preferences.

When I get a moment, I am going to try adding some films to the Silk switches and see if that evens things up.

If you have a minute, give them both a listen and see which you prefer.

[^sbs]: Please excuse the hideous looking 2u backspace.
[^jwk]: You could compare these to just about any other JWK switch. I went with the Dry here to keep my comparisons as close as possible (spring weight, when it was manufactured, etc.).
