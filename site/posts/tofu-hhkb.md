I was searching for a Happy Hacking HHKB on eBay and came across a listing for KBDFans Tofu with an HHKB layout. The board looked to be in good shape and had a price much better the Happy Hacking. I figured it was a good and cheap way to try out the HHKB layout.

When I got the board, I was very impressed with the condition. The previous owner had also included some T1 switches, which I did not initially pay much attention to.

I decided to fully break down the board and clean up as much as I could.

1. Cleaned the case and brass weight.
2. The generic clip in stabs were replaced with Durock screw-in stabs, lubed (Dielectric grease), and band-aid modded.
3. The T1 switches were lubed with Krytox 203 G00.
4. I installed GMK Mito Pulse keycaps.

When I was done, two things quickly jumped out to me.

1. The Tofu is solid. Overall, the build quality, weight, and feel were far beyond what I expected. In a perfect world, the corners would have been rounded a bit, but for the price, you cannot go wrong.
2. The T1 switches lubed sounded much better than I expected. Up until this point, I was in complete denial about lubing switches. That changed immediately.

For better or worse, I decided to test a business hypothesis around selling semi-custom keyboards. It sold pretty quickly, which is a shame. If I could go back, I would have kept this board.
