I am still working through the last stages of the Key65 rebuild.

The Key65 standard package includes a piece of plate foam. I did not plan on using it, but I figured it was worth a quick test.

I regret the test. Fighting with the foam led to quite a few bent pins getting the switches into the hot-swap plate, and there were was no noticeable change in the acoustics or typing experience. I will be skipping it in the final soldered build.

I am also leaning towards going with a silent switch in the spacebar. I guess there is one more test to do. :)
