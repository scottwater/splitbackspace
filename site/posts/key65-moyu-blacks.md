Below are sound profiles for the following three plates:

1. Carbon Fiber
2. FR4
3. Brass

All use the same Moyu Blacks (tactile), which have been lubed with Trybosis 3204 (Krytox 105 on the springs) in a Key65 with a hot-swap PCB.

I enjoy the tactile bump on the Moyus, but the sound feels too loud and in your face. If I had to choose, I would go FR4, Brass, and then CF. I was hoping to put these in a Canoe Panda, but now I think I will go in a different direction.

Let me know your favorite?
