The Mira SE GB originally ran back in 2017 around a time I thought $100 was a steep price to pay for a keyboard.

Lucky for me, I found someone who had purchased three of them (not sure why) and had yet to build it. So although it was technically three years old, it had not yet seen the light of day.

Overall, it is a solid board. Both in terms of usability and weight[^wife].

My only real gripe with the board is the front height. I do wish it was a couple mm shorter. It is still usable, but certainly not my last TKL.

* Marshmallows are my favorite JWK. I know they are all the same, but these feel special even though they use a much lighter spring. I could always spring swap others to be the same, but well, I think the pink/white does the trick.
* As mentioned before, I am not the biggest fan per switch RGB, but I do really enjoy a good underglow.
* I have tried a variety of keycaps on this board, but I always come back to MoDo.



[^wife]: My wife moved it once on my desk and asked, why is this so heavy. :P
