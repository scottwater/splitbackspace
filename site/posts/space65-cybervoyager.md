The Space65 CyberVoyager is the follow up to GrayStudio's popular Space65.

Here are my early impressions of this build (not just the Space65)

## Pros

* For $299, you are getting quite a bit of keyboard.
* The Space65 has an elongated design that, in some ways, feels like a large iPhone. However, it is a welcome change to the world of 65% keyboards.
* The variety of accent colors provides a lot of options to customize the board. I bought the Black Gold colorway. However, I also bought white accents and will eventually go with more of a Panda look.
* GMK Dark is much better in person than in photos. The contrast + light is not a tremendous photographic match.
* The creamsciles (Tangy housing + NK Cream stem) has a great sound and feel.
* The LED on the left is an interesting alternative to underglow. I could do without the second LED on top (unless you can use it as a layer indicator). I was playing around with a Knight Rider (KIT) look for the first build.

## Cons

* The IC lists a 5% typing angle. I measuring 4% via my phone. The difference of 1% is not that big of a deal, but overall I find it a bit flat.
* The badge (top color accent) is connected with a small magnet. So far, I have had to re-glue all three that I have used. I would have preferred this been connected via an internal screw (see more below)
* The badge is not entirely flush with the case. This makes it easy to remove to change, but also very easy to bump off. I would have it rather been completely flush, even if that made changing it more difficult.
* One of the design knocks on the original Space65 was the screw holes are covered by the case feet. This has not changed and is a miss. Most people do not open their cases often, but considering you can still see two of the screws, I am not sure why the other two needed to be covered.
