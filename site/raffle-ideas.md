## Steps that can be taken to minimize fraud in a raffle

1. Discord (or other) Sign up/verification - This puts a road block in place to prevent rapid entries. It can be worked around, but slows sign-ups and by requiring verification you put a major impediment in place.
2. Discord Servers - Look for other known keyboard discords. It is very unlikely that someone one have just one (or even a couple) discord servers they belong to if they are interested in a high end mechanical keyboard. I have verified this is possible. Discord does warn you that you are sharing the info, so some might take this as a turn off. But as mentioned below, you might be able to make it optional and use it in the weighting for selecting winners.
3. IP address - This should be unique for most users
4. Devise finger printing - There are free and expensive options here. The better ones are very hard to beat.
5. Tor networks - Is someone trying to hide their location?
6. Anonymous browser sessions - Similar to Tor.
7. Billing Zip for IP address - Does the billing address fall with in reasonable proximity of the IP address
8. Disposable email addresses - Is the email disposable? Does it look like something that is used for just entering raffles
9. Interest list (via an IC) - Give bonus points to someone who signed up early for info and has been following from the start
10. Your own discord - Are they a member of your discord
11. Are they human - ensure the submission is not made in an automated means. This could be watching for mouse movements, a simple Q&A, etc.

## Using all the data

From what I have seen, most raffles use some of the data to try and exclude very obvious abusers. This is better than nothing, but it generally only excludes those to who are blatantly trying to cheat. **I would recommend using the data above as a means to weight a random draw**. Someone who signed up for the IC early, joined the discord, etc would have a better chance. There is a chance that your billing zip and IP do not match. You may not want to exclude someone outright for this, but let it be a slight ding against their chances

## How?

This would require a small custom app. I already have done much of the work flow (especially around Discord). You would not be able to use something like Google Forms since you do not get enough data and have limited customizability.

The form would capture all the configuration data, but it would not charge them. You would eventually have to bill them via another app (Shopify, PayPal, etc). All the data should be exportable, so hopefully that makes it easy to move it into something like Shopify.

## Issues

With any raffle, you run the risk of someone simply signing up to help a friend or family member. A short window and questions related to the product/discord/designer/etc can help make this less of an issue, but it will not outright prevent them. In general, the longer the open window the more likely this will be an issue.

Another interesting thing you can play with, is charging more for the wrong answers. The Lin Whale recently charge a significantly higher price if you answered a question wrong.
