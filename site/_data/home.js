  intro: `
This is my (Scott Watermasysk) personal site.

I am a bootstrapped business founder & advocate, ruby on rails developer, husband, father, sometimes basketball coach, and appreciator of fine keyboards. I love to build things.

I have worked at startups (we call them small businesses on the east coast) for nearly 20 years. This site is a collection of what I am working on, learning, and find interesting.

## Projects

[KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com) - I guess a _project_ is a stretch since this is also my livelihood. ðŸ˜€ KickoffLabs is a platform for **growing your business with viral marketing contests**. I have been working on it for about eight years (March 2011), and it is still going strong.

[Bootstrap Weekly](https://bootstrapweekly.com) - This is a weekly newsletter for bootstrappers that has been on hiatus for a couple of years. I have a new direction for it and you should see it pick back up in 2020.

[How I VSCode](https://howivscode.com) - A simple way to share how you are using VSCode.

[Eleventy Origin](https://github.com/scottwater/eleventy-origin) - I am a big fan of Eleventy (static site generator). It is the right mix of power and simplicity. Origin is my personal starter template.

[Indie Triage](https://indietriage.com) - Tries to help ensure all questions asked on sites like Indie Hackers get answered. (_Paused for now. APIs are not solid enough to build on yet_)

[Jekyll Rest](https://github.com/scottwater/jekyll_rest) - An API for Jekyll ([more details](/jekyll-rest)). It should be usable across other platoforms as well...which I will verify soon for this site.

[Shorti](https://github.com/scottwater/shorti) - Simple API only URL Shortener ([more details](/shorti)).

[New Jersey Bootstrappers](https://njbootstrappers.com) - Still in its infancy stage, I am hoping to grow & connect a community around small self-funded business ideas.
