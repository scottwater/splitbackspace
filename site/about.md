The only site on the internet dedicated to split backspaces[^sbs]. :P

This is the personal site of Scott Watermasysk. I have blogged about software, business, and more on [ScottW.com](https://scottw.com) for many years. My keyboard related posts and desire to write more about this hobby felt out of place on my other site, so moved it all here.

I lurked in the shadows of the community for a couple of years. I just could not convince myself to jump in. However, for a variety of reasons I gave it ago with a WASD Code and slowly started experimenting with other off the shelf mechanical keyboards. I made the mistake along the way of purchasing MX Blues for a ErgoDox EZ and started digging into various switches and got bit by the custom keyboard bug.

My primary keyboard use case is writing and coding.

The thing I enjoy most about this hobby is there are no absolutes. Almost everything (even the beloved split backspace) comes down to personal preference. You can listen to others advice and experience, but you really need to try it yourself.

For layouts, just about everything works for me except ergo. I will typically have something with arrows on my desk when I am coding and something without for regular computer usage. I try to switch between various boards every couple of days.

[^sbs]: Just kidding, but if you want more, read, [Should You Use Split Backspace](https://splitbackspace.com/posts/splitbs/).
